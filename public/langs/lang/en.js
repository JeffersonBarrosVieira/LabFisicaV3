    section2__card1__title: `Physical Simulation`,
    section2__card1__content: `Often due to the impossibility of testing techniques and solving hypotheses directly in the real world. We are forced to solve problems through an analogy with reality: Simulation.`,

    section2__card2__content: `Simulations use models in many cases if an analytical solution is possible. If these retain characteristics: PHYSICAL and LOGICAL of the imitated REAL SYSTEM, it will bring results close to reality.`,

        `The science of mechanics seeks to provide an accurate and consistent description of the dynamics of particles and particle systems [1], thus, a mathematical representation of motion using physical laws based on experimental facts. Before breaking into the applications, it is necessary to know some fundamental concepts, such as:`,
        ` - Distance;`,
        ` - Time.`,
        `With them, it is possible to understand: velocity and acceleration of a given body. Therefore, in this section we will first deal with movements without their causes, that is, the geometry of the movement (kinematics). Then their (dynamic) implementation.`
